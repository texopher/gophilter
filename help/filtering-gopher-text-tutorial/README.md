               PREFACE
  -------------------------------------

World wide web is great but it has many distractions (ads, medias, etc.). That is the reason 
of having 'texopher - Textify World Wide Web'. HTML is converted to gopher text, then it is 
filtered by filter file from 'gophilter' project. The results is that users only view main 
text without distractions like ads. This tutorial guides you how to make filter files, and 
contribute to 'gophilter' project or use them as the personal project.
