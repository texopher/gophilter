An unauthorized person hijacked Bubba Wallace’s radio during a race on
Sunday, telling NASCAR’s only Black driver he wasn’t “wanted” in the sport.

During the All-Star race at North Wilkesboro, North Carolina, the
unidentified person managed to finagle their way onto Wallace’s team radio
channel right before Wallace was about to finish in second place, according
to
sports outlet The Spun.

“Go back to where you came from, you asshole,” a male voice was heard saying.
(For the record, Wallace is from Alabama.)

“You suck, and you’re not wanted in NASCAR,” the alleged hacker said a few
seconds later.

Luckily, Wallace was not aware of the hateful comments until after he
finished the race, The Spun reported.

Motorsport reported that NASCAR is working to find the person who hacked the
radio.

During an event on Saturday before the the All-Star Race Sunday, Wallace was
met with a wave of negativity in a series of boos from the crowd, but he
brushed off the criticism, the Outkick reported.

“As long as you continue to live your life, judging a book by its cover,
that’s who you are,” Wallace said in an interview, shared by the Outkick.

In 2020, Wallace found a noose hanging in his garage after he led a movement
to ban Confederate flags from racing events. Ultimately, however, the FBI
determined that he was not the victim of a hate crime and the noose had been
in that position months prior.

Sunday was not Wallace’s only issue of radio interference. In 2018, a person
jumped on his radio to proclaim “white lives matter” during a race in
Charlotte, Racing News reported.

“As the sport’s lone Black driver, Bubba has played a critical part in
NASCAR’s push for inclusion and equality, including its ban of the
Confederate
flag at races,” according to a bio on Wallace’s website.
