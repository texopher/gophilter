Featured review

Family Practice In Obfuscation of Morals

I'm intrigued by this patriarchy, a blending of familial story lines that
segue from one dysfunctional atrocity to the next. Like witnessing a
torturous
train wreck that reveals one train car to hold more carnage than the one
previously revealed; we're carried along to decide for ourselves which of
these halfwits is even remotely capable of stepping out from under their
fathers expansive wing span. I'm completely taken aback by previous reviews
that dispel the notion that this is compelling viewing, and find myself drawn
into the plots and devices. I've long considered myself a fan of Adam McKay's
story telling, and I'm afraid I must disagree with those who've pronounced
this as 'unwatchable'. From one sibling to the next, theirs is a cautionary
tale of raising your children to be loathsome human beings, that attributable
wealth can breed contentious offspring that will feast on the flesh of others
while laughing at the horror left in their wake. That a spine isn't
inherited,
and weakness isn't easily overcome. In this world, we witness the sowing of
what they willfully reap- with repercussions meted out on a slow burn that
may
or may not bring casualties. I'm intrigued and can say without pause that
this
is a triumphant return to the greatness that once was HBO, and hopefully more
to come, after the lackluster choices we've been witness to in the last
decade
or so from the likes of Girls, Vinyl, Rome, etc and more in keeping with some
of the best television has to offer in Sopranos, 6FU, etc. Count me in on
this
one. For now at least.
