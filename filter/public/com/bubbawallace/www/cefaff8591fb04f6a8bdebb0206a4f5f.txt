BUBBA WALLACE

Darrell “Bubba” Wallace drives the No. 23 Toyota Camry for the new Michael
Jordan and Denny Hamlin owned 23XI Racing team in the NASCAR Cup Series, the
top racing circuit in America.

As the sport's lone Black driver, Bubba has played a critical part in
NASCAR's push for inclusion and equality, including its ban of the
Confederate
flag at races.

A graduate of NASCAR Drive for Diversity program, Wallace first drew
headlines in 2013 when he became the first African-American in 50 years to
win
in one of NASCAR’s top three national touring series when he won his first of
six career NASCAR Truck Series races.

Then in 2018, Bubba became the first African-American to become a full-time
driver in NASCAR's premier Cup Series. In 2021, Bubba then became the first
Black driver to win a race in NASCAR’s premier series since Hall of Famer
Wendell Scott took the checkered flag at Speedway Park in Jacksonville, Fla.,
on Dec. 1, 1963.
