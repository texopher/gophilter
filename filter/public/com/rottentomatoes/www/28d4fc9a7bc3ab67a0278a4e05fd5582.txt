First discovered by audiences as a confident, fresh-faced comic who was
proficient at playing outrageous characters and sending up famous
celebrities,
actor Jamie Foxx cut his teeth on the small screen when he joined the popular
television sketch comedy, "In Living Color" (Fox, 1990-94) after its first
season. Not satisfied with being confined to strictly comedy, Foxx surprised
many when he began displaying considerable talents both as a dramatic actor
and as a classically trained musician. He offered glimmers of things to come
with a strong performance in "Any Given Sunday" (1999), which allowed him to
show off the gridiron prowess he developed as a star high school quarterback.
While he continued to perform stand-up comedy in several cable specials, Foxx
reached the top of his career with a defining and unforgettable performance
as
music legend Ray Charles in the biopic, "Ray" (2005), which earned Foxx the
best notices of his career and an Academy Award. Foxx continued to surprise
audiences with action movies like "The Kingdom" (2007), heartrending dramas
like "The Soloist" (2009), wild genre films like "Django Unchained" (2012)
and
stylish action comedies like Edgar Wright's "Baby Driver" (2017), all of
which
reminded people that Foxx would not be easily defined. Behind the scenes, he
served as executive producer of a sitcom based on his own early stand-up
career, "White Famous" (Showtime 2017- ).
