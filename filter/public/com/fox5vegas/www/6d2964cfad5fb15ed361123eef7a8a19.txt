LAS VEGAS, Nev. (FOX5) - The National Transportation Safety Board released a
preliminary report following the investigation of an April 11 plane crash
that
killed two people.

According to the report, the single-engine Glasair plane intended to fly from
the victims’ winter residence in Nevada to their primary home in Iowa, with
an
overnight stop planned in Dallas. The flight left at 4:08 a.m.

Security footage from a private residence nearby showed that the plane
“rapidly descended to the ground” and crashed at 4:19 a.m.

Wreckage from the crash was found distributed over a distance of 920 feet. A
post-accident investigation found large plastic shards in two intake sections
of the plane’s engine. The report also noted that “the fuel selector was in
an
over-extended position” and the fuel filter and cooling reservoir were both
punctured.

The plane was last inspected six days before the crash. The mechanic that
signed it said that he “wasn’t familiar with the engine,” and added that the
pilot performed all the maintenance on the plane. That last inspection
indicated that the plane had a total time of 446.6 hours in the air.
