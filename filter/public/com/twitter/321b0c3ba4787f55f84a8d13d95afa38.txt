TRACEY THORN ON TWITTER: "WATCHED THE SUCCESSION FINALE WITH OUR
MORNING COFFEE AND NOW WHAT THE HELL DO WE DO WITH THE REST OF THE
DAY" / TWITTER

Watched the Succession finale with our morning coffee and NOW what the
hell do we do with the rest of the day

Barry?

Make more wonderful music ? ! üòÅ Seriously though, get outside,
enjoy the sunshine, maybe find some inspiration....... But please
don't leave it so long for the next new EBTG release. Love listening
to Fuse (& taking a trip down memory lane with all the other albums !)

I'm v eager for my brother to watch it to discuss it but he hasn't
watched ANY of series 4 year as he wanted to gorge it all over a few
days so I'm biting my tongue here.

Listen to the new EBTG album? ü§î

I was tempted to watch it first thing, but I‚Äôm leaving it for this
evening, with a beer. Now I just have to avoid Succession Twitter all
day. Shades of the Likely Lads!

You SAY NOTHING

Hug your children.

I just watched it...... ü§ê

...watch Severance!

Can‚Äôt watch it until tonight! There‚Äôs a famous episode of The
Likely Lads about precisely this!
