@bubbawallace’s response to the boos aimed at him during his
#AllStarRace intro. #NASCAR

Love it!

Thinking he has been chatting with Kyle

Shits priceless.

This how you do it Bubba! 👏🏾👏🏾

LOVE IT!!! Haters gonna hate

This is 1 more reason why he's a DISGRACE to NASCAR.

Hopefully he is suspended from nascar indefinitely for the middle
finger on live tv he’s just showing his true colors

the fans do not like him, it's his attitude they don't like. after his
interview with jamie little no wonder they don't.

Bubbly your a great driver, but what you did afterwords is just what
they want! Your a better man then that, don’t let it get to ya! Or
you won’t be here much longer, you know what I mean! Good luck!

I wish they would get rid of him but they won’t they are to scared
to get rid of a black
