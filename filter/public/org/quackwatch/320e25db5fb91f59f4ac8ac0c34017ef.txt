Quackwatch, which is operated by Stephen Barrett, M.D., is a network of Web
sites and mailing lists maintained by the Center for Inquiry (CFI). The sites
focus on health frauds, myths, fads, fallacies, and misconduct. Their main
goal is to provide quackery-related information that is difficult or
impossible to get elsewhere. To help visitors with special areas of interest,
there are sites that cover autism, chiropractic, dentistry, multilevel
marketing, and many other problematic areas. The Internet Health Pilot site
provides links to hundreds of reliable health sites. Casewatch contains a
large library of legal cases, licensing board actions, government sanctions,
and regulatory actions against questionable medical products. All of these
can
be accessed through the “Visit Our Affiliated Sites” drop-down menu above.
Their contents can be searched all at once through our search page. We also
offer a Health Fraud Discussion List with more than 550 members and Consumer
Health Digest, a free weekly e-mail newsletter that summarizes scientific
reports, legislative developments, enforcement actions, and other information
relevant to consumer protection and consumer decision-making. Its primary
focus is on health, but occasionally it includes non-health scams.

Our home-page hits reached 1 million in March 2000, 5 million on August 2004,
10 million in July 2009, and 15 million in December 2019.
